# ðŸŒ¾ Drought Phase Prediction App

This Streamlit web application uses machine learning (Random Forest) to predict drought phases based on survey and environmental data. The app also provides interactive visualizations, feature importance, and real-time prediction from user inputs.

ðŸ”— **Live App:** [Streamlit Deployment]([(https://drought-prediction-project.streamlit.app/)])

ðŸ“‚ **Dataset:** Cleaned and preprocessed dataset hosted at:  
[https://github.com/studentofstars/Drought-Prediction/blob/main/data_labels_cleaned.csv](https://github.com/studentofstars/Drought-Prediction/blob/main/data_labels_cleaned.csv)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project was developed as part of a college mini-project to understand and forecast drought phases in Africa. The dataset contains survey-based features, and the target variable is **Drought Phase Classification**.

**Key Goals:**
- Build a reliable drought prediction model using scikit-learn
- Make drought prediction accessible through a clean UI using Streamlit
- Visualize trends and geospatial insights related to drought occurrences
- Help local decision-makers and communities better prepare for dry periods
